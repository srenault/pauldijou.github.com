            <h3 id="tldr-coz-im-a-h4k3r">TL;DR 'coz I'm a h4k3r</h3>
            
            <p>Full source code of the demo is <a href="https://github.com/blogsamples/play-browserSync">on GitHub</a> with a nice and simple README on how to bootstrap the project.</p>
            
            <h3 id="what-are-you-talking-about-dude">What are you talking about dude?</h3>
            
            <p><a href="http://www.playframework.com">Play Framework</a> is an HTTP server written in Scala. It is super cool and you should probably give it a try. Let's say you are using it, you really enjoy how productive it is, only having to refresh your browser to see all your code modifications, but you want to go further, you want live-reloading! There are several tools doing that.</p>
            
            <p>Introducing <a href="http://www.browsersync.io">BrowserSync</a>. It provides 2 killers features. One is live-reloading: it can monitor resources, and when it detects some modifications, it will reload the browser page to load them. Even better, if possible, it will hot deploy them, meaning they will be loaded without reloading the page. That's the case for CSS files which are loaded and the page repainted to display the new design without any refresh. The second one is to keep synchronized several browsers across devices. And we are not talking about resources only but about all user actions. If you scroll on one browser, it will scroll on all connected browsers, same for clicking on a button, and so on…</p>
            
            <p>Let me say it again with a concrete example. You are on your computer, one screen with your source code, another one with Chrome opened and a last one with Firefox. You also have an iPad tablet and an Android smartphone connected to your computer. All of those have your application main page opened. Each time your edit your code, they will all reload and display the new result (hot deploy in case of CSS). When you are ready to test interactions, you just go to, let's say, your Chrome browser and start scrolling and clicking. All your screens will start moving and doing the actions everywhere. Talk about increasing productivity!!</p>
            
            <p>What about assets that require compilation? Such as SCSS, LESS, Stylus, CoffeeScript, etc… No biggy bro (or sis), we have you covered. In this demo, we will use <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> to monitor those resources, compile them, and pass them to BrowserSync for live-reloading (obviously not losing the hot deploy if possible). You can freely use whatever build tool you want, be it Grunt, Broccoli, …</p>
            
            <h3 id="magic-proxy">Magic proxy</h3>
            
            <p>BrowserSync could be used as the web server, that's the easiest way to use it, and I'm actually doing it when my Play server is only here to provide a REST API. Consider doing that when you don't need Scala templates or when you cannot use them (for example if you want to embed all your standalone HTML files inside a Cordova / PhoneGap application).</p>
            
            <p>But here, we want to use Play as the web server, meaning it will be responsible to serve all our assets: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For that, we will need to use the <code>proxy</code> feature of BrowserSync. Long story short, it will start another web server, on its own port, and will display the exact content from the Play server but adding a bit of JavaScript magic in it so it can enable all its features. It is just like opening your Play application, just on a different port. By default, you would use the port <code>9000</code> for Play, in this demo, we will set the proxy on port <code>9001</code> (it would have been around <code>3000</code> by default, but I didn't want anyone to freak out so I put it as close as possible to Play default one).</p>
            
            <p>We also want to live-reload some of our resources. I kept it simple for this demo, but you are free to add as many as your want. We will use the <code>files</code> property of BrowserSync configuration and set and array of files to monitor (it supports wildcards). Here, we are monitoring all CSS files from <code>public/stylesheets</code>, JavaScript files from <code>public/javascripts</code> and HTML files from  <code>app/views</code>. There are two important points to notice here. First, we are referencing files based on their path on the source code, not on their actual url. For example, <code>public/stylesheets/main.css</code> will be served by Play as <code>assets/stylesheets/main.css</code>, but BrowserSync only needs to know the real path, after that, you can map it to whatever url you want. Second, we are monitoring Scala templates, and it's fine because when BrowserSync will detect a modification, it will reload the page, and Play will re-compile the template before serving it, so it will display the new version. It works just fine with both <code>run</code> and <code>~run</code> , the latest being faster.</p>
            
            <p>Here is a super small configuration for BrowserSync to enable such a proxy. You can read the <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/">online documentation</a> to extend it.</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">var browserSync = require('browser-sync');&#x000A;&#x000A;browserSync({&#x000A;  // By default, Play is listening on port 9000&#x000A;  proxy: 'localhost:9000',&#x000A;  // We will set BrowserSync on the port 9001&#x000A;  port: 9001,&#x000A;  // Reload all assets&#x000A;  // Important: you need to specify the path on your source code&#x000A;  // not the path on the url&#x000A;  files: ['public/stylesheets/*.css', 'public/javascripts/*.js', 'app/views/*.html'],&#x000A;  open: false&#x000A;});&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <h3 id="what-about-compiled-assets">What about compiled assets?</h3>
            
            <p>Right… right… there are assets that you cannot serve directly, you need to preprocess them. The easiest way to do that is using a build tool, just pick one among the best ones (Gulp, Grunt, Broccoli, Brunch, …) and enjoy. There is a really simple separation of concern here: the build tool only manage assets that are not served directly (LESS, CoffeeScript, …) and compile them into assets that are actually handled by BrowserSync (CSS, JavaScript, images, …) which then live-reload them.</p>
            
            <p>It's so easy that it's nearly frustrating. In the demo, the <code>main.css</code> file is generated from <code>main.less</code>. I have two Gulp task to handle that: one for compilation and one to monitor any modification.</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">var gulp        = require('gulp');&#x000A;var less        = require('gulp-less');&#x000A;&#x000A;// Registering a 'less' task that just compile our LESS files to CSS&#x000A;gulp.task('less', function() {&#x000A;  return gulp.src('./resources/less/main.less')&#x000A;    .pipe(less())&#x000A;    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/stylesheets'));&#x000A;});&#x000A;&#x000A;// Let's watch our LESS files and compile them at each modification&#x000A;gulp.task('watch', function () {&#x000A;  gulp.watch(['./resources/less/*.less'], ['less']);&#x000A;});&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <h3 id="wait-where-are-sbt-web-and-webjars">Wait, where are sbt-web and webjars?</h3>
            
            <p>Yeaaaaah… so lately, Play has introduced all those stuff on managing assets using SBT, some plugins and webjars. It works just fine but for me, it's just as strange as if I would install Play from NPM. It's cool if people want to try to merge two super different worlds (front-end and back-end), be it Node.js or scala.js, but I'm totally not ready for that. As a full stack developer, I want to enjoy each world with its own ecosystem, not trying to bend one into the other.</p>
            
            <p>That's why in all my projects, front-end assets are handled by front-end tooling (mostly Gulp and NPM lately) and my back-end resources by back-end tools (SBT, Ivy, Maven, …). Not only do I get the best of each, but I do not have some limitations. For example, the other day, I came across a bug on a JavaScript library I was using. No biggy: fork the repo, correct the bug, do a pull request. And while waiting for the author to merge it (which can take some time), I am free to directly use my fork inside my <code>package.json</code> so it's not blocking at all. It tooks me less than an hour. I would be curious on how to do that using webjars? Anyway, sorry for not planning any proof of concept using webjars if that's what you are using.</p>
            
            <p>And that's it! As I said at the beginning of the article, the demo is <a href="https://github.com/blogsamples/play-browserSync">on GitHub</a>, feel free to clone and play with it. Enjoy and thanks for reading.</p>

          <div class="content">
            
            <p>Once again, I will not explain what <a href="http://prismic.io">prismic.io</a> is (but it's a tool to manage your website content), I will only focus on one limitation and how to solve it. If you don't know about prismic.io, you should quickly check its website before reading any further.</p>
            
            <h3 id="whats-the-problem">What's the problem?</h3>
            
            <p>In prismic.io, you are creating Documents which are composed of Fragments. A fragment is data organized in a more or less semantic way. For example, a fragment can be a Number, or a Date, … Among them, there is the type Image which is really nice because you can not only fully resize / crop your raw picture, but also add smaller images based on the original one for responsive purpose. You can upload your awesome photo of this beautiful sunset, fully sized at 4000 x 3000 pixels, resize it for desktop at 1920 x 1080, and finally add a mobile version at 320 * 480. Note that the last one doesn't respect the ratio at all, but that's the goal: you are creating a subset of your image with the best match possible regarding the targeted screen.</p>
            
            <p>Another really powerful fragment in prismic is the StructuredText. It allows you to have a nice WYSIWYG editor inside which you will put new fragments (paragraphs, links, titles, images, …). It would be perfect if the image fragment inside a StructuredText was a real Image fragment, but it is not. You cannot specify any thumbnail. Meaning your content cannot be responsive at all. Your choice is: consume all the bandwith for mobiles with awesome full HD images or make the eyes of your desktop users bleed with super compressed images.</p>
            
            <h3 id="you-dont-want-to-do-that">You don't want to do that!</h3>
            
            <p>And me neither! I want to have responsive images inside my StructuredText for God sake. I love tools which make my life easier, but they never should stand on my way to craft the best website possible. I will not lie to you, I couldn't find any solution that integrates nicely with the WYSIWYG editor since there is no way to extend it. The following solution will be a bit of hacking and your writers might complain about it at first.</p>
            
            <p>So, what's the idea? The only way to have responsive images is to use a real Image fragment, no choice here. So let's create one, and let's put it inside a Group fragment. This way, you can add and remove as many images as you want and they will all be responsive. Wait, you can't do that inside the StructuredText, right? Indeed, that's why we will do outside of it and then find a way to bring back the images inside of it. Here is the mask for such a group:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">"Images" : {&#x000A;  "images" : {&#x000A;    "type" : "Group",&#x000A;    "fieldset" : "Images",&#x000A;    "config" : {&#x000A;      "fields" : {&#x000A;        "name" : {&#x000A;          "type" : "Text",&#x000A;          "config" : {&#x000A;            "label" : "Name"&#x000A;          }&#x000A;        },&#x000A;        "caption" : {&#x000A;          "type" : "Text",&#x000A;          "config" : {&#x000A;            "label" : "Caption"&#x000A;          }&#x000A;        },&#x000A;        "image" : {&#x000A;          "type" : "Image",&#x000A;          "config" : {&#x000A;            "thumbnails" : [ {&#x000A;              "name" : "mobile"&#x000A;            }, {&#x000A;              "name" : "tablet"&#x000A;            } ]&#x000A;          }&#x000A;        }&#x000A;      }&#x000A;    }&#x000A;  }&#x000A;}&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Pro Tip</strong> - When creating thumbnails for an Image fragment, the <a href="https://developers.prismic.io/documentation/UjBeuLGIJ3EKtgBV/repository-administrators-manual#document-masks">offical documentation</a> states that both width and height are mandatory. This is <strong>wrong</strong>, you can specify only one of the two or even none of them. Your UI might be a bit ugly (the resized thumbnails will only display after saving your draft) and sometimes you will have to click twice on a button (this one, I really don't understand) but otherwise, it works just fine. I hope prismic guys will make those attributes optional because… well… how can you anticipate how the writer wants to resize its image?</p>
            
            <p>As you can see, I added two more fields. One is <code>name</code> and we will use it to reference our images inside the StructuredText. The other one is <code>caption</code>, that's because I want to put one on my images but prismic didn't allow me to do that at all by default. Thanks God, using this solution, I can finally do it, killing two birds with one stone. Now we can add as many responsive images as we want, yeah! Let's grab some orange juice to celebrate!</p>
            
            <h3 id="lets-hack-some-html">Let's hack some HTML</h3>
            
            <p>As I already said it, the next step will be to bring those images inside the StructuredText. We cannot do that directly inside the WYSIWYG editor but we can do it when rendering the final HTML. We will need two more things here:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>having a placeholder inside the StructuredText to indicate we should insert an image</li>
              <li>extend the default HTML renderer to support such placeholder</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As for the placeholder, I decided to use a simple format like <code>{image-[name of the image]}</code>. Meaning that if the content of a paragraph inside my StructuredText is <code>{image-sunset}</code>, it will actually render the image named <code>sunset</code> from the group of images when generating the final HTML. Pretty easy right? Your writers might find it ugly, having to write those strange tags, and not seeing their images directly inside the StructuredText, but just tell them that's for the greater good. You could, of course, use another syntax, eventually support attributes, whatever.</p>
            
            <p>The final task, and probably the hardest one, is to extend the HTML rendering system. Each primisc fragment has its own way to render as HTML. Unfortunately, there is no way to extend it, you can only, eventually, override it. And the one for StructuredText is by far the most complex one. The easiest way to do that is to copy/paste the default one from the kit you are using (if you are not using any kit, you are free to do whatever you want, so it's fine) and edit it. You will then edit the part responsible for rendering a paragraph, test if its content match our placeholder syntax, if so, render an image, if not, just render the text as it is. Since I'm using the JavaScript kit, here is the <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou/farewell/blob/9a744565d7e66f06aa9a3edf7e360db0f00c70aa/scripts/prismic.js#L65-L159">full copy/paste</a> but that's the <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou/farewell/blob/9a744565d7e66f06aa9a3edf7e360db0f00c70aa/scripts/prismic.js#L105-L117">important part</a> where we are rendering the image. My <code>model</code> is actually a JavaScript class extracted from the original prismic Document, but you could use the raw Document of course.</p>
            
            <h3 id="conclusion-and-limitations">Conclusion and limitations</h3>
            
            <p>That's pretty much it. Here is a quick summary of what to do:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>inside the mask, add a Group of Images with, at least, a Text fragment for the name.</li>
              <li>choose a naming convention to write placeholders inside a StructuredText, ex: <code>{image-[name]}</code></li>
              <li>override the StructuredText HTML rendering function with a custom one inserting images from the Document when finding a placeholder</li>
              <li>you can add more attributes and render them (like a caption)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>What are the bad points / limitations of the solution?</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>writers need to write placeholders rather than having a nice UI to insert images</li>
              <li>images do not display natively in the WYSIWYG editor anymore</li>
              <li>you cannot re-order a Group fragment right now, meaning images will be sorted based on their created date and not on their place inside the StructuredText</li>
            </ul>

          </div>
          <div class="content">
            
            <p>Last week, on Wednesday, I had a meeting with some colleagues at <a href="//movio.co">Movio</a> about the <a href="http://scaladownunder.org">Scala Downunder</a> conference. It's a Scala conference in Auckland, New Zealand, with speakers from Typesafe and local ones, and some replay from Scala Days. I discovered that we were doing the website for the conference here at Movio, and also that it was due for the following Friday in order to send it to Typesafe for feedback…. Ah, and also I would be crafting it.</p>
            
            <p>(Pssst… okay, there has been some commits on the repo after the deadline, but that's only because the schedule totally changed, not my fault!)</p>
            
            <h3 id="lets-get-started">Let's get started!</h3>
            
            <p>So, deadline is 2 days from now, the website is only one long page with all classic stuff: presentation, speakers, schedule, location and sponsors. Really good point: both the design and the content are nearly fully done. Otherwise, it would have been impossible.</p>
            
            <p>My first step was to pick my tooling. I truly hate copy/pasting anything so it was out of question to copy/paste HTML when it comes to iterable data. I needed a static HTML website generator. Since the plan was to publish it on GitHub Pages, I choose <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. This way, I would have the build for free, only needing to push on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch my source code (at the end, that didn't work at all, but Jekyll is still a good choice). Bootstraping with Jekyll is super fast as long as you already have Ruby installed on your machine.</p>
            
            <p>Next I picked <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> as my build tool. I love both <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and Gulp, but I'm trying to be more familiar with Gulp lately (at some point, I will switch to <a href="https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli">Broccoli</a> anyway). Here is one <strong>important point</strong>: you should have snippets for each Gulp (or Grunt) task ready somewhere so you can do your setup in minutes. For example, here, I wanted to use <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> as CSS preprocessor, <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> for JavaScript packaging and <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a> for live-reloading. I already got all those snippets, so I just needed to copy/paste them once in order to have my server running live and compiling all my assets.</p>
            
            <h3 id="be-semantic-with-your-content">Be semantic with your content</h3>
            
            <p>Remember, what's the most important is your content, not the design nor the funky JavaScript effects. And don't try to rush to apply funny colors or amazing transitions before having a real content behind them or you might not see the real behaviour when implementing them. Since I already have it, I wrote only HTML during the first hour. It allows me to be 100% semantic with my content. I don't care about CSS selectors or whatever, if this is a paragraph, I create a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, if this is a section, let's use a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag. And at the end, you can already see the 0.0.1 version of you website, fully "usable" (just a bit ugly, and tons of typos).</p>
            
            <p><img src="/blog/assets/2014-07-30/downunder001.png" alt="downunder001" /></p>
            
            <p>After that, I worked to all dynamic parts of my HTML. I really wanted to have full content before starting doing any LESS. I used the <code>_data</code> folder of Jekyll that allow me to structured data in YAML files. I put all speakers and schedule in it. After that, it's all about the <a href="http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics">Liquid templating</a> system to render it. You have <code>for</code> loops and <code>if</code> blocks, you have filers to render Markdown or whatever, for such a simple website, it was more than enough.</p>
            
            <p>At this point, we are something like nearly half a day in the project and we have all the content and a nice setup allowing us to be super productive. It could have been faster, but there was quite some content to write and it took me a bit more time than planned to implement all my templating. That's cool!</p>
            
            <h3 id="do-it-with-style">Do it with style</h3>
            
            <p>As you can image, the next step is doing all the website design. If possible, I prefer to write all CSS classes first, staying close to the HTML semantic and then implement them rather than inventing crazy CSS selectors and then bind them to your HTML. It's important to know what's your browser target. Because, trust me, you want to use <code>flexbox</code> but that means IE10+ (using a LESS mixins for old syntax). Lucky me, I could do that. If not, consider using a grid system.</p>
            
            <p>When doing the design, never <strong>ever</strong> think "Oh, it looks already pretty good… I shouldn't be far away from the end". There is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> that apply a lot to CSS in my opinion. It means that in just two hours, I had a decent design, but in the and, it costs me a full day to have the final thing. Why? Because after having done the main style, you will start testing on other browsers, on other devices, find small bugs, and spend way too much time to correct them. Also, at some point, if you can, you should review the website with the designer, and this is vital but sometime really hard. He will probably want to reach pixel perfection and nobody can blame him for that, take time and probably some refactoring, and also some hacks. At the end, you will have spent 20% of your time having a nice (but not perfect) design on Chrome, and 80% having a pixel perfect design on most modern browsers, being responsive, and having a decent fallback on old ones.</p>
            
            <p>It was a pretty simple design so it was quite straightforward. Just remember you can do magic with pseudo-elements. I use them a lot for all those forms (circles, traits, …). Flexbox is doing an awesome job to overcome old CSS limitations (Who said vertical align?) and being responsive. This way, I didn't have do use any open-source CSS project except for my reset, using the awesome <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>.</p>
            
            <p>I also decided to use pure SVG rather than a font for my icons. This decision was based on reading great articles from Chris Coyier, like <a href="http://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/">this one</a>, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/">that one</a> and finally <a href="http://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/">this battle one</a>. All worked fine.</p>
            
            <h3 id="finish-the-script">Finish the script</h3>
            
            <p>During the last half day, I focused on writing the small JavaScript needed for the website. There really wasn't much of it: double sticky navigation bar, nice scrolling between sections and modal panel for each talk description. Let's be honest, since I am targeting IE10+, I totally didn't need jQuery. But if you check the source code, you will find it. Why? I was starting to run out of time and I really wanted to use some nice plugins to leverage all the grunt work. Also, using one of the last version of jQuery, it will be fast enough and will not add too much of a payload. So… it's fine.</p>
            
            <p>I finally had the chance to use <a href="http://julian.com/research/velocity/">Velocity</a>, a jQuery plugin for animations. It works just great, super fast even on mobile. You should try it. It powers both the scrolling and the modal animation. For the stick navs, I choose the <a href="http://stickyjs.com/">Sticky plugin</a> which is simple and great. Nothing more to add. I packaged all that stuff with Browserify, but more because I love this tool rather than because it was needed.</p>
            
            <h3 id="going-further">Going further</h3>
            
            <p>So, why didn't it work to only push to <code>gh-pages</code>? It did at first, but then I started to use more complex features with Jekyll 2.x and, guess what? GitHub Pages still use a 1.x Jekyll version, so it didn't match. Also, I wanted to do post generation stuff, like <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-usemin">usemin</a> to minify all my assets and append then with a hash version, also updating the index HTML file. I just had to wrote a simple <a href="https://github.com/movio/scala-downunder/blob/master/_gulp/deploy.js">deploy script</a> in order to overcome the problem.</p>
            
            <p>I don't really want to go through all the details, but you can see the <a href="http://scaladownunder.org/">final result</a>, read the <a href="https://github.com/movio/scala-downunder">full source code</a>, and here are a few highlights:</p>

            <h3 id="holy-cow-callbacks">Holy cow, callbacks!</h3>
            
            <p>For the last (and only) website I did using prismic.io, I didn't want any back-end, all client-side, pure JavaScript man. This way, I could host it nearly anywhere for pretty much free (GitHub pages FTW). To ease stuff, I decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/prismicio/javascript-kit">JavaScript kit</a> from the prismic.io team.</p>
            
            <p>One choice they made and that I don't really like is using callbacks in it. For example, you have to write stuff like:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Get the current API&#x000A;Prismic.Api('/my/awesome/url', function (err, api) {&#x000A;  if (err) {&#x000A;    // handle error&#x000A;    return;&#x000A;  }&#x000A;&#x000A;  // Use the API there, retrieving documents&#x000A;  api.form('articles').ref(api.master()).submit(function (err, articles) {&#x000A;    if (err) {&#x000A;      // Also error again&#x000A;      return;&#x000A;    }&#x000A;&#x000A;    // But I also need authors...&#x000A;    api.form('authors').ref(api.master()).submit(function (err, authors) {&#x000A;      if (err) {&#x000A;        // One more time, handle error&#x000A;        return;&#x000A;      }&#x000A;&#x000A;      // Now I got all my data&#x000A;      // I can finally display it on my page&#x000A;    }&#x000A;  });&#x000A;}, 'my_token_far_below_at_the_end');&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Can you see it? This ugly thing JavaScript experts name "callback hell"? And that's a super simple example. In 2014, the way to do that is using Promises. That's what's hype (and readable, and nice, and cool, and swag). But I quite understand why they made this choice. Promises are not native everywhere yet, so going with it mean either writing your own implementation or imposing an existing one. Fair enough to have callbacks in the kit then, but we are hackers here, we can override it to use Promises!</p>
            
            <p class="alert alert-danger">I will use the last spec Promise syntax, native way baby!, but it is really important to keep in mind that it has <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=promises">a really poor support</a> right now. You should probably be using a Javascript library as Promise implementation. I will link a snippet of code using the <a href="http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/">Q library</a> at the end of the article. But I wanted this article to be future proof.</p>
            
            <h3 id="omg-promises-o">OMG, promises \o/</h3>
            
            <p>There are two main callbacks in the kit: when retrieving the API and when making a <code>submit</code>. What I want to write is something like:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">Api('/my/awesome/url', 'my_token_right_here_at_the_start')&#x000A;  .then(function (api) {&#x000A;    return Promise.all([&#x000A;      api.form('articles').ref(api.master()).submit(),&#x000A;      api.form('authors').ref(api.master()).submit()&#x000A;    ]);&#x000A;  })&#x000A;  .then(function (data) {&#x000A;    var articles = data[0];&#x000A;    var authors = data[1];&#x000A;    // Display the results&#x000A;  })&#x000A;  .catch(function (error) {&#x000A;    // Handle error&#x000A;  });&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Sooooo much more readable and swag… Overriding the Api callback is really simple:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Remove the callback from the function signature&#x000A;function Api(url, accessToken, maybeRequestHandler, maybeApiCache) {&#x000A;  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {&#x000A;    // Put a callback that will only resolve/reject the deferred depending&#x000A;    // on the presence of an error or not&#x000A;    Prismic.Api(url, function (err, resolvedApi) {&#x000A;      if (err) {&#x000A;        reject(err);&#x000A;      } else {&#x000A;        // Save point 1 (see below)&#x000A;        resolve(resolvedApi);&#x000A;      }&#x000A;    }, accessToken, maybeRequestHandler, maybeApiCache);&#x000A;  });&#x000A;}&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Overriding the <code>submit</code> call is a bit more tricky because it is a prototype function of the <code>SearchForm</code> object, which is totally hidden inside Prismic clojure. This is a bit (super) sad but we can deal with it by creating a fake form and not submitting it. The easiest way I found so far is doing it right after getting the Api. Let's add the following code at <code>Save point 1</code> (see previous code).</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// You might need a polyfill for 'getPrototypeOf' if you support old browser&#x000A;var SearchFormProto = Object.getPrototypeOf(resolvedApi.forms('everything'));&#x000A;// We are saving the original function so we can call it inside our override&#x000A;var originalSubmit = SearchFormProto.submit;&#x000A;&#x000A;// Let's override!&#x000A;SearchFormProto.submit = function () {&#x000A;  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {&#x000A;    // As before, the callback will only resolve / reject the deferred&#x000A;    // depending on the returned value&#x000A;    originalSubmit.call(this, function (err, docs) {&#x000A;      if (err) {&#x000A;        reject(err);&#x000A;      } else {&#x000A;        resolve(docs);&#x000A;      }&#x000A;    });&#x000A;  });&#x000A;};&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>And after that, you just need to use the new <code>Api</code> function in place of <code>Prismic.Api</code>. You can see <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou/farewell/blob/9a744565d7/scripts%2Fapi.js#L8-L32">the full code here</a> using <code>Q</code> library. This refers to a particular commit to ensure the line highlight is correct but you can freely switch to the master branch to see the most recent code (which shouldn't be much different… but who knows…).</p>

          <div class="content">
            
            <h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
            
            <p>If you don't know about <a href="https://prismic.io/">prismic.io</a>, it's a nice tool providing both a super clean web interface to write content and an API to retrieve it. No front-end provided, eventually some kits to help you and some examples, but no more. Which is cool because, if you are a web developer, you can focus on crafting an awesome optimized website and then easily put some content in it… well, that's the theory…</p>
            
            <p>But for me, after using it for a new website, as good as the idea can be, I have found way too much limitations to consider it production ready. The team behind prismic.io is working on most of them so I really hope the implementation will become as awesome as its concept at some point in the future.</p>
            
            <p>The rest of the article will focus on bashing all those limitations, so there will be way more bad than good, but don't get me wrong, prismic.io has tons of good stuff, and it's still in beta, I just want to talk about what I don't like in this article. And since I'm not all about trolling, I will try to consider how to solve them at the end. I will not explain what prismic.io is exactly, so it might be for the best that you quickly check their website before continuing reading. Enjoy.</p>

            <p>I will never forget… it all started on this windy saturday… I was looking for a solution to create a new blog about traveling. I didn't want to use an all-in-one tool because I love crafting my UI from scratch, with exactly what I want on it (this point is super important for the rest of the story). I said bybye to Wordpress and all its friends. If I were alone, I would have probably go with raw Markdown or whatever, but I am not… I have other people that travel with me and want to write articles without learning a super complex geek syntax. I will call them… <em>writers</em>. Some colleagues of mine told me about you… that you might be the future of content management, that I would be free for the UI, that you had WISIWIG editors and stuff for… <em>writers</em>, sounds like a perfect match, and so our adventure began.</p>
            
            <p>I still can't believe how fast it all went… in a couple of hours, we were able to write new articles and display them in a custom website hosted in GitHub pages. Using one of your kits, it was so easy to query your API, retrieve the content as JSON and inject it inside Handlebars templates in order to render the final HTML. Oh man… it was so good.</p>
            
            <h3 id="and-then-fictions-appeared">And then fictions appeared</h3>
            
            <p>A few days later, I wanted to go further, moving forward to more crazy stuff. I know that sometimes I try to do complex features just for the fun of the challenge it provides me, but still, how could you do that to me… Remember this conversation?</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Hey prismic.io, I would like to query documents that does not match this predicate</li>
              <li>Ahahah, you so funny, no way…</li>
              <li>Thanks! Wait… what? Why not?</li>
              <li>I don't have a <code>NO</code> operator or whatever close to it.</li>
              <li>Whyyyyyy? You have crazy operators like <code>similar</code> to retrieve similar documents based on God know which algorithm and you cannot do a simple negation?</li>
              <li>Nope. Deal with it.</li>
              <li>Okay… I think I can manage something if the query match this <code>OR</code> that. That's fine, right?</li>
              <li>No.</li>
              <li>Cool! Wait… what?</li>
              <li>I only have <code>AND</code> operators between predicates.</li>
              <li>You gotta be kidding me…</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I was a bit sad, but I could manage it, retrieving too much documents and filtering client-side. Still, that was the starting point were all went wrong.</p>
            
            <h3 id="my-biggest-mistake-using-structuredtext">My biggest mistake: using StructuredText</h3>
            
            <p>All contents in prismic.io must be typed. This is an image, this is a number, etc… A StructuredText is probably the most powerful type since it allows writers to enter complex content through a WISIWIG editor, using paragraphes, images, lists, embedded stuff, … They can style it using bold, italic, and so on. It looks nice, right? So I decided to use it for the main content of my articles. Fair enough. As always, it was so great to have writers doing their own design using the editor, and so easy to render it automatically as HTML (except for some bugs here and there, but that's what pull requests are for, isn't it?). At some point, I just wanted to have a lightbox on some images: clicking on them should expand it to its full sized version with a caption. I don't know for you, but for me, this is a really basic requirement and you should be able to do it in less than 2 hours.</p>
            
            <p>First problem: I wanted to tag images that should have lightbox with <code>[data-lightbox]</code> HTML attribute, all images didn't need one. Since I was using the JavaScript kit to render my HTML, I couldn't do that at all. There is no way to add custom rendering or plugins in the HTML renderer from the kit. Dammit. So I rewrote the full renderer so I could customize it… Wait, how can I indicate which image has a lightbox and which hasn't inside a StructuredText? Oh, right, I just can't. Inside a StructuredText, you can only drop raw images and resize them, that's it. Does that mean I cannot put nor caption or title? Yep, no way to do it. So I started to hack: if after an image, the following paragraph would begin with <code>[caption]</code>, the image would be a lightbox, the content of the paragraph would be its legend, and the paragraph itself would be removed from the final rendering.</p>
            
            <p>Guess what? Writers didn't really like having to manually write <code>[caption]</code>, they wanted a nice UI to do that… but that was just impossible… They throw some tomatoes at me and we tried to move on but we couldn't… Solving one problem to discover a new one: when you define a type <code>image</code> in a Document, you can tell that it will have different sizes: one for desktop, one for tablet and one for smartphone for example. And that's awesome because you can fully optimize for mobile, which is super important nowadays. Do you think you can do that with image inside StructuredText? Indeed, the answer is no! Once again, a great idea not fully supported. Is there a workaround? Sadly, no easy one. You can upload the same image several times, one for each size, then find a way to retrieve its generated ID by prismic.io and use the same hack as <code>[caption]</code> to specify it and hack a bit more the HTML renderer. I couldn't find the courage to do it… pretty sure tomatoes would have been replaced by rocks from writers. I can only hope my mobile users have 4G now.</p>
            
            <p>Want more? No biggy, I have tons of stories like that. A writer wanted to have blockquotes: a whole paragraph should be displayed in a custom design and have an author. I had to kill him really fast and bury his body deep. Another one wanted semantic distinction between paragraphs, something like: this one should be red and this one blue just because. Thrown him into a bucket full of piranhas. At some point, a writer became a madman and deleted half of documents… no way to find him since the delete operation does not appear in the timeline. But who cares? I mean, the document are gone anyway. I18N, do you speak it? I hope not because there is <a href="https://qa.prismic.io/29/will-multi-lingual-sites-be-supported-in-the-future">no support for it… yet</a>. Want to put some tables? Could you please <a href="https://qa.prismic.io/25/how-do-we-best-support-tables">stop joking</a>, it hurts me to laugh so much. Want do  <a href="https://qa.prismic.io/55/improve-the-media-library">manage hundred of images</a> in the media library? Might be less painful to jump from the top of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower">Eiffel tower</a>. And so on, and so on…</p>
            
            <h3 id="we-didnt-fully-link-anymore">We didn't fully link anymore</h3>
            
            <p>Writers are generally really proud of their work, so they want everybody to know about it. I couldn't just display "Title of the article". If I wanted to stay alive, I needed to display "Title of the article, by an awesome author", and if you would click on the name, you would access to a page saying how incredible the author was. As always, I was like "No biggy dudes, this is gonna be easy". I wasn't bluffing at that point since there is this nice feature that allow you to link documents between them. So every author would now have a dedicated document of type Author, where he could write whatever description he wanted, and each document of type Article would be linked to an Author. So far, so good.</p>
            
            <p>And then the problem: if I get a list of Articles, I only got ids and a link to the Author resources, but I do not actually have the data on the Author document, which means I cannot display the real name of the author. And guess what? There is no aggregation or join possible in the API. You just cannot say that you want the 20 most recent articles with their authors. Solutions are: request all authors and then retrieve the good ones from ids (that's 2 requests, and I did that since I don't have that many authors), or do N+1 request (1 for articles, N for authors, one per author id from articles), or generate dynamically a request for authors using <code>any</code> operator (something like <code>[:d = any(my.author.id, [id1, id2, ...])]</code>). In any case, you need multiple requests, eventually not running in parallel, and with too much payload… mobile first, right?</p>
            
            <h3 id="i-never-though-you-would-mask-it-from-me">I never though you would mask it from me…</h3>
            
            <p>One core concept in prismic.io is Document Mask. Each document must have one and it represents its pattern, how it will be persisted in prismic.io database and how it will be served by the API. So you start creating masks, easy. It directly provides a slick UI for writers to enter content. Nice! And at some point, you realize you could have done better, the mask can be improved. Just don't do that, keep going with your broken mask, trust me!</p>
            
            <p>Let's say you don't trust me (that's fair enough, you don't even really know me). If you rename any property of the mask, you are screwed. The new property will be empty since it doesn't consider it a renaming but the suppression of the previous property and the creation of a new empty one. But you are super courageous, so you migrate all your documents to the new property, yeah! Now you have duplicate a property in your API. Hell yeah! Just check the raw JSON, you will see the new property (thanks God) but also the old one. Properties just keep adding, prismic.io never forget… <strong>never!</strong> Your payload will just increase. And be sure that your front-end developers always only rely on the mask definition, never on the data from the API, because… it doesn't mean anything anymore.</p>
            
            <h3 id="my-heart-was-so-fragmented">My heart was so fragmented…</h3>
            
            <p>So, let's summarize what's the biggest problem with prismic.io: you can only do what the tool allow you to do. And right now, it allows you only super basic features. Which are needed obviously, but when you go to the real world, you know, outside of the matrix, those are just not enough. Imagine being Mario, you need to save the princess but you can only move forward, no jump, no strange mushroom, no yoshi… Good luck! Direct consequence, the killer feature that would make prismic.io really powerful, in my humble opinion, is what I will call "custom fragments". The idea is to allow developers to create their own type of fragments and plug them both in the UI of the writing room and in the HTML renderer. That might sounds a bit challenging but it isn't that hard in fact.</p>
            
            <p>So first, how to create a custom fragment? Let's use the mask system. When defining a document, you are creating a mask saying "this document will have an image and some text as title". Why not doing the same for custom fragments? Remember the lightbox problem? I would create a custom fragment <code>lightbox</code> which is composed of an image and some text as its caption. Even better, since I am now using a real <code>image</code> type, I can specify several sizes for the image. Big win here.</p>
            
            <p>Next, inside the writing room, how to render a custom fragments? Well, you already know how to render all its pieces, just group them together with an indentation or a left border or whatever. The <code>lightbox</code> fragment would be an image selector and a text input. Of course, you should be able to put a custom fragment both inside a document (like any other fragment) and inside a StructuredText if possible (just like you are allowing <code>em</code> or <code>h2</code> inside a StructuredText)</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Let's define our custom fragment for lightbox,&#x000A;// just the same syntax as a Document Mask&#x000A;{&#x000A;  "title" : {&#x000A;    "type" : "Text",&#x000A;    "fieldset" : "Title",&#x000A;    "config" : {&#x000A;      "placeholder" : "A short caption for the image"&#x000A;    }&#x000A;  },&#x000A;  "image": {&#x000A;    "fieldset" : "Image",&#x000A;    "type" : "Image",&#x000A;    "config" : {&#x000A;      "thumbnails" : [ {&#x000A;        "name" : "Icon",&#x000A;        "width" : 100,&#x000A;        "height" : 100&#x000A;      }, {&#x000A;        "name" : "Column",&#x000A;        "width" : 320,&#x000A;        "height" : 320&#x000A;      }, {&#x000A;        "name" : "Wide",&#x000A;        "width" : 600,&#x000A;        "height" : 300&#x000A;      } ]&#x000A;    }&#x000A;  }&#x000A;}&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Finally, each kit should have a <code>renderFragment(type, json =&gt; html)</code> method that allow you, for a specific fragment type (here <code>lightbox</code>), to pass a function that know how to render the final HTML from its raw JSON.</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Define how to render your custom fragment&#x000A;// from JSON to HTML (which is a String)&#x000A;kit.renderFragment('lightbox', function (json) {&#x000A;  var html = '&lt;img src="';&#x000A;  html += json.image.url;&#x000A;  html += '" data-lightbox title="';&#x000A;  html += json.title;&#x000A;  html += '"&gt;';&#x000A;  return html;&#x000A;});&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Hey, we can do even better, let's add a second argument to the rendering function, this one will be the original rendering function for "native" fragments in prismic.io. This way, you can override just one or two "native" fragments. For example, if you want to render <code>image</code> with a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> HTML tag because that's super hype. Just do something like:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Override an already existing fragment&#x000A;kit.renderFragment('image', function (json, original) {&#x000A;  var html = '';&#x000A;  html += '&lt;picture&gt;';&#x000A;  // Keep it easy, only one source...&#x000A;  html += '&lt;source src="' + json.image.url + '"&gt;'&#x000A;  // Fallback using the default renderer&#x000A;  html += original(json);&#x000A;  // And the alt text&#x000A;  html += '&lt;p&gt;' + json.image.alt + '&lt;/p&gt;'&#x000A;  html += '&lt;/picture&gt;';&#x000A;  return html;&#x000A;});&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>And that's it! You just solved so many limitations…</p>
            
            <h3 id="i-didnt-understand-your-semantic-anymore">I didn't understand your semantic anymore…</h3>
            
            <p>Ok, next step. Inside a StructuredText, I need to have semantic distinction between fields of the same type. This paragraph is <em>important</em>, this one is <em>a blockquote</em> and all the rest are <em>normal</em>. Let's go the easy way: I just need a hash of key -&gt; value, as strings, to reach a limitless world. This way, I could tag one paragraphe <code>important: true</code>, and another with with both <code>blockquote: true</code> and <code>author: Someone</code>. At last but not least, expose it in the API:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Since all fields have a common structure to expose their type&#x000A;// it's easy to have a new key like 'attributes' at this level&#x000A;// to expose the semantic hash&#x000A;// (btw, it would be cool to map to primitives rather than only string for values)&#x000A;{&#x000A;  "type": "paragraph",&#x000A;  "text": "bla bla bla...",&#x000A;  "spans": [],&#x000A;  "attributes": {&#x000A;    "blockquote": true,&#x000A;    "author": "Someone"&#x000A;  }&#x000A;}&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>I have no idea how to integrate that in the UI of the writing room, but I know its designer, he will figure out something awesome, no doubt.</p>
            
            <p>By adding that, you leverage tons of possibilities for developers to customize the rendering of a StructuredText without any heavy hack. Writers would still need to manually write each key name, but its way better than paragraphs starting with <code>[caption]</code> or <code>[author]</code>. Following a snippet on how to render a blockquote, using the previous <code>renderFragment</code> method of course:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">kit.renderFragment('paragraph', function (json, original) {&#x000A;  if (json.attributes.blockquote) {&#x000A;    var html = '&lt;blockquote&gt;';&#x000A;    // Previously private (at least in the JavaScript kit),&#x000A;    // I hope this method will be available in all kits&#x000A;    // it applies all span styles to the raw text&#x000A;    html += kit.insertSpans(json.text, json.spans);&#x000A;    html += '&lt;footer&gt;';&#x000A;    html += json.attributes.author;&#x000A;    html += '&lt;/footer&gt;';&#x000A;    html += '&lt;/blockquote&gt;';&#x000A;    return html;&#x000A;  } else {&#x000A;    return original(json);&#x000A;  }&#x000A;});&#x000A;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This feature is for "quick and dirty" hacks if you could say, and allowing you to customize "native" fragments. Because otherwise, you could also have done that with a custom fragment. Rather than having two attributes, a <code>blockquote</code> could be a custom fragment grouping a StructuredText for the content and a simple text for the author. It is way more intuitive in the UI and it's easier to create its own <code>renderFragment</code>.</p>
            
            <p>I like a lot this <code>renderFragment</code> method, but I think we can make it even better! Right know, we can only specify / override for all the application. That's super cool but limited… and if you have read carefully until now, you should know that I don't like limitations. This method should be at least at 3 different levels:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Document instance</li>
              <li>Document type</li>
              <li>(Collection?)</li>
              <li>Application</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Here is the idea: when an instance of a Document wants to render some fields (or fragments) as HTML, it will do the following simple procedure:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Hey, do I have a custom renderer method for this type of field on myself? (yeah, because now each Document instance have the method). If so, use it, if not, continue.</li>
              <li>I am a Document of type Article, does this type of Document has such a method on it? (yeah, because now you can call this method for just a particular type of Document). Yes, use, no continue.</li>
              <li>Eventually, does my Collection have the method?</li>
              <li>Nearly finished, does the method is defined at the application level?</li>
              <li>If nothing found so far, if it is a native prismic.io field, render it as it should be, otherwise just crash or return empty string, I don't know, it shouldn't happen anyway.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Holy crap… we just created a "rendering context with awesomeness inheritance" or something like that. Can you imagine all the things you could do with that? Can you ?! I can't… it's too big…</p>
            
            <h3 id="lets-break-up">Let's break up</h3>
            
            <p>I could say more, but since it's a miracle that you are still reading and it would not be as relevant as what I already said, I will stop here.</p>
            
            <p>My conclusion so far: prismic.io is not ready for the real world and for real websites but there is a lot of work going on by its team so, as they say on half of their responses: stay tuned! It might become super awesome at some point (I hope it will).</p>
            
            <p>Thanks for reading! See you soon for more hacky coding posts.</p>
